Voting is a critical method by which a group of individuals can collectively make decisions or express their opinions. Given the potential far-reaching consequences of voting outcomes,
it is essential to maintain the integrity of the process. This involves preventing fraud and cheating, ensuring that each person can vote only once,
and making sure that the process is conducted fairly and justly.

The accompanying Python code exemplifies a basic voting system that emphasizes voter registration, 
secure voting, and the prevention of multiple votes by the same individual. 
This system ensures that only registered voters can cast votes, 
and it maintains transparency and fairness by accurately counting and displaying the voting results.
